#Light Up my Pebble

The application has to be run on the Pebble application installed on the smartphone, which can be an Android or iOS device.
The code has to be copied in a project created on cloudpebble.net.
The account on cloudpebble.net has to be recalled in the smartphone application. Once the application and the devices are paired, go on the menu -> settings and check "enable developer". Done this in the menu the voice "Developer" compairs. Open this voice, look if it is listening on the right server. 
Go back on the cloudpebble.net and press the green button on the right. If everything goes well the application should be installed on the phone and on the smartwatch.
In the smartwatch menu the name of the project should be displayed.
